TODO: 
 - Get on HPC and get comfortable. 
 - Implement supervised model on OGBN-MAG
    - Implement GraphSage (maybe edit. Transformer on top)
 - Implement self-supervised model on OGBN-MAG
 - Characterize embeddings
 - Use embeddings on downstream tasks and evaluate results. 
 - Uncertainty Estimation (Using ensemble methods) - Nice to have
 - 

Stretch goals
 - Apply it to some nice climate data -TBD
 - Apply it to social graphs and finance (Heterogeneous)

Deadlines:
   10/11 - Working implementation of supervised model on OGBN-MAG (Everyone in jupyter notebook)
         - Working implementation of unsupervised model. (Gabriel)
         - Understand theory basics. Be secure. 
         - Write synpsis. 
         - Start writing theory section of report ()
   17/11 - Write to python file (not notebook)
         - Write plotting code.
         - Run on HPC.
