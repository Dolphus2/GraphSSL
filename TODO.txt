TODO: 
 - Get on HPC and get comfortable. 
 - Implement supervised model on OGBN-MAG
    - Implement GraphSage (maybe edit. Transformer on top)
    - 
 - Implement self-supervised model on OGBN-MAG
 - Characterize embeddings
 - Use embeddings on downstream tasks and evaluate results. 
 - Uncertainty Estimation (Using ensemble methods) - Nice to have
 - 

Stretch goals
 - Apply it to some nice climate data -TBD
 - Apply it to social graphs and finance (Heterogeneous)
